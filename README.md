Title of Your Project: Predicting Elder Fraud

Short Description of Your Project and Objectives:
Our machine learning goal is to protect elders against fraud. 

Name of Your Selected Dataset and Programming Language: 
Python, Campus Analytics Challenge 2021: Machine Learning Model to Predict Suspected Elder Fraud 


Description of Your Selected Dataset (source, number of variables, size of the dataset, etc.): 
The source of our dataset is mindSumo. The dataset is 14000 rows by 24 columns for the training data. The test data is 6000 rows by 24 columns. This dataset has timeseries data and we decided to drop columns with time stamps. There are several missing values in the dataset for carrier name, region name, device type, customer state, and state province.

Purpose:
Wells Fargo seeks to detect any suspected elder fraud in the digital payments. This way Wells Fargo can protect their customers from fraudulent activities.

Background:
Banks are required to report suspected vulnerable financial exploitation. Today, much of this activity is limited to human interaction (bankers working with customers on the phone or in person), through which bankers may pick up queues, or red flags or customers self-reporting scams or financial abuse to their financial institution. Digital payments have a degree of reported fraud and claims, with the assumption that much more unreported losses occur, especially perpetrated against older adults (60 years of age or older). As digital payments continue to expand across all demographics, research shows that older adults are showing the biggest uptick in adoption during the 2020/21 period due to the pandemic. Currently, digital payment data is not analyzed specifically under the vulnerable (elder and dependent adult) financial exploitation lens. Banks are required to report elder financial abuse but, unless a customer reports fraud and files a claim, financial abuse can go undetected and repeated fraud via digital payments can continue without the banksâ€™ knowledge. Without detection models, a large amount of fraud is left unreported by consumers and elder and vulnerable adult populations will be at greater risk of being targeted and losing savings to fraudulent payments.
